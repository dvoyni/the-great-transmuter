## Rules

Transmute elements to fill the consumer.

Transmuters have one or more rules. Rule will be chosen and activated if all elements of required types are came to transmuter. 

Every rule consist of 3 parts: 
[X][Y][Z] 

Where: 

[X] - element type that rule accepts. If more than one - elements with all types should be provided to activate the rule. "?" means element of any type is accepted. 

[Y] - arrow, where element will go out of transmuter for this rule. 4 direction arrow means that direction will not be changed 

[Z] - element type that will go out from transmuter for this rule 


Have fun!
